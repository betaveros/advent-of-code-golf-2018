.Dangers .. it's too hard to juggle the stack; let's assign it to a variable
.. this is just E in the golfed version

.. Finite areas must be in the minimal bounding box of the points; if an area
.. contains a cell on the edge of that bounding box, it contains all cells on
.. the ray emanating from that cell away from the bounding box.
™ .. copy and transpose, so we have one list with two lists: all x's and all y's
ε .. for each of those lists:
  ŒqÆ .. compute the minimum and the maximum
}
.. so we have minx, maxx, miny, maxy on the stack
.. first we're going to make the cartesian product of ranges:
{
  …d .. apply inclusive range twice, obtaining ranges [minx..maxx] [miny..maxy]
  *¨ .. take cartesian product and flatten
}q .. do all this but keep the result under the four extrema
‡d .. Make two 2-length lists: we now have [minx, maxx], [miny, maxy]
¦\ .. Duplicate both and swap
{  .. This should consume [a, b] [c, d] and create [a,b]*[c..d].
  ~  .. expand onto stack
  …  .. compute inclusive range
  *¨ .. cartesian product and flatten
}d .. do this twice
Ð  .. map with reverse (swap coordinates) in the higher list
+  .. concatenate the results

.. We now have two lists on the stack, each with pairs of coordinates:
.. the lower one is a list of all coordinates in the bounding box;
.. the higher one is a list of all coordinates on the boundary of the bounding box.

{ .. The below happens to both such lists:
  μ .. Map this block, the goal of which is to find the closest point, or nothing if not:
    .. (The messiness of the whole block means we probably want a "find a list of all minima/maxima" built-in)
    ; .. Pop. Even though we're mapping we'll want this later, so we'll just use the X-stack,
    .. which gives us access to nearby iteration variables.
    9k: .. Accumulate a closest danger and a distance (assuming 9000 is an upper bound...)
    .. (The initial value of the closest danger doesn't matter so we'll arbitrarily use the same huge number randomly.)
    .. The closest danger will be a falsy sentinel if there's a tie.
    Dangers ε .. For each point:
      Z .. loop variable of outside loop, the coordinate under consideration
      ±zŠ .. find absolute distance
      <k .. if less: (stack: closest danger, closest distance, distance, greater)
      ;_ .. then just pop the distance, nothing happened
      {  .. else:
        .. now the new distance is correct yay
        .. "else"_debug
        .. (closest danger, closest distance, distance)
        >k .. if greater:
        X  .. X (current danger)
        &p .. boolean and
        .. (old closest danger, old closest distance, correct distance, correct danger)
        .. stack manipulation is painful
        ¸u .. pop under, under
        ¸u .. pop under, under
        \ .. swap
      }
      ? .. do the if
    }
    ; .. leave the danger

    .. this code was an earlier attempt and maybe more concise,, but the
    .. extra loops seem like it will make things even more painfully slow
    .. {±zŠ}b .. bind a "zip with absolute value, then sum" (i.e. compute Manhattan distance) block
    .. Dangers .. push the list of points
    .. \    .. swap: stack contains [list of points, abs-distance block]
    .. Œq   .. find the Point with mininum distance, but keep the list and block, and push the answer under (it's a point)
    .. %    .. map the block (wow I didn't know we still needed this)
    .. :Œ   .. copy and find minimum
    .. #    .. count how many times that minimum appears
    .. Î    .. is it 1?
    .. \{}? .. if so, otherwise do the empty block
    .. idk I didn't check this
  }
  .. Because I probably chose the incorrect behavior of - on sequences as of
  .. v0.2.15 (it subtracts them like Counters or multisets, not like sets,
  .. which is just too fancy to be useful sadly)
  .. I have to do some stupid hacking.
   f .. filter by the identity function to get rid of the out the sentinels
  $G .. sort and group
}d .. ...double all of that so it happens to both lists.
+$‹_G .. Concatenate (the list of groups), sort, and group by first element.
.. Groups that include any points from the boundary will result in groups of
.. groups of length two, otherwise, of length 1.
«_- .. Groups of two should be discarded.
.. Now we have groups of one.
¨ .. Flatten once.
Lm .. map length
Æ  .. find the maximum
